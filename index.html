					<p><strong>The Asian Pacific American Center</strong> is the newest addition to the Smithsonian Institution. I was asked to create a promotional booklet that established the branding for the museum and functioned as a tool for their funding phase. APAC is looking to establish themselves as a modern and tech-forward museum, and wanted the branding to reflect that position.</p>
